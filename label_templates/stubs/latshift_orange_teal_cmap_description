It was created by clipping that array's values at +/- 15 and transforming them
with a perceptually-uniform diverging (two-sided) colormap (named 'orange_teal')
with center (black point) at 0. This is intended to highlight areas of difference
between measured temperature values and the overall latitudinal trend within a
particular time / frequency bin.
