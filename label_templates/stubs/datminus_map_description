This product contains time-binned, model-subtracted lunar brightness
temperatures derived from deconvolved Chang'E-{orbiter_num} Microwave Radiometer
(CE-{orbiter_num} MRM) antenna temperatures at channel {channel} ({channel_ghz} GHz),
presented in equirectangular projection at {ppd} pixels per degree and organized
into separate HDUs of a FITS file, one HDU per {ltst_binsize}-hour local time bin
with valid data. The DATMINUS HDUs of this FITS file were generated by subtracting
the TBMOD HDUs of t{channel}_tbmod_{ppd}ppd.fits from the TEMP HDUs of
{orbiter}_t{channel}_temp_{ppd}ppd.fits (after cropping the TEMP HDUs to the
latitude range of the TBMOD HDUs).
