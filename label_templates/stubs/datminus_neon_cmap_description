It was created by clipping the array at its 2nd and 98th percentiles, subtracting
the array mean, and transforming the resulting values with a perceptually-uniform
diverging (two-sided w/distinct slopes) colormap (named 'neon_r') with
center (black point) at 0 (corresponding to the mean of the percentile-clipped array).
This is intended to highlight areas of difference between the modeled and
observational data. The mean shift and variable scale are used because (1) magnitude
of differences can vary greatly even within a single frequency band over the course
of the diurnal cycle and (2) the model will almost always be "hotter" than the
observational data because it does not account for the dielectric loss tangent;
subtracting the mean is an attempt to adjust for average loss tangent in order
to better show the effects of its variability across the surface.
