This product contains time-binned, latitudinally-adjusted lunar brightness
temperatures derived from deconvolved Chang'E-{orbiter_num} Microwave Radiometer
(CE-{orbiter_num} MRM) antenna temperatures at channel {channel} ({channel_ghz} GHz),
presented in equirectangular projection at {ppd} pixels per degree and organized
into separate HDUs of a FITS file, one HDU per {ltst_binsize}-hour local time bin
with valid data. The LATSHIFT HDUs of this FITS file were generated by removing a
simple latitudinal trend (best fit to the function `a + cos(temperature) ** b`,
with `a` and `b` as free variables) from the corresponding TEMP HDUs of
{orbiter}_t{channel}_temp_{ppd}ppd.fits.
