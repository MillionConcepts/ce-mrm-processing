This product contains modeled time-binned lunar brightness temperatures at
{channel_ghz} GHz. It was created by interpolating observational data from
Kaguya/SELENE LISM and LRO Diviner, LOLA, and LROC within the parameter space
of a physical heatflow model. These values are presented in equirectangular
projection at {ppd} pixels per degree and organized into separate HDUs of a
FITS file, one HDU per {ltst_binsize}-hour local time bin.
