This product contains modeled time-binned lunar brightness temperatures at
{channel_freq} GHz. It was created by interpolating observational data from Kaguya
SELENE and LRO Diviner, LOLA, and LROC within the parameter space of a physical
heatflow model. These values are presented in equirectangular projection at {ppd}
pixels per degree and organized into separate HDUs of a FITS file, one HDU per
{ltst_binsize}-hour local time bin.
